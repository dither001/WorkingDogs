#### Working Dogs (FIXME: Rework intended mod features)
* (Enhancements to the experience of having dogs as companions throughout the game)
* (Improvements to the Dogs A.I which make them more reliable and refined than vanilla Wolves/Dogs)
* (Train your dogs with Talents!)
* (Reduce the fear of losing your beloved dogs with a Tracking System and a Revival System.)

Credit to all the developers who have come before me (if you contributed to Doggy Talents or DTN and you don't see yourself listed, please send me a note and I will update this list). Before I so much as publish an alpha build for distribution or testing, I will track down as many of the developers who have contributed to this project.
 * **RaustBlackDragon** for creating the original mod and ideas back in 2013
 * **ProPercivalalb** for the outstanding work of re-coding and perfecting the mod from the old and relatively buggy version and for continuing the developement until 1.18.2
 * **NovaViper** for coding help and maintaining order in the DoggyTalents Project until 1.18.2
 * **DashieDev** for development of Doggy Talents Next
 * **MashXP** for development of Doggy Talents Next

-----------------

#### Short-, and Long-term Goals
 * I initially forked this project from Doggy Talents Next with the intention of "Umplifying" the code, removing copyright-protected material, generalizing, streamlining, and eventually expanding the codebase to create a wholly original mod. My wife and I have been playing Minecraft together and while we both enjoy encountering mobs in the wild, we feel they are significantly lacking in "presence." Starting with tameable mobs, I hope to eventually overhaul the entire mob ecosystem with homes, behaviors, items, and so forth.

Umple is a declarative template language used to generate code in any of several different possible programming languages, including Java. I have been using Umple to assist my programming since 2019 and I have learned a great deal about how to leverage Umple for managing large and complex projects. To "Umplify" code means to translate raw Java classes into the declarative format of Umple. Some Java code is preserved, and indeed some programming paradigms are difficult to duplicate in Umple.
